In the root directory of the project, create a new file named `.gitattributes`. Populate it with the following content. This will enforce consistent line endings for all text files and prevent Git from modifying binary files.

# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
* text=auto

#
# The above will handle all files NOT found below
#
# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout.
*.js      eol=lf
*.jsx     eol=lf
*.ts      eol=lf
*.tsx     eol=lf
*.css     eol=lf
*.html    eol=lf
*.json    eol=lf
*.md      eol=lf
*.sql     eol=lf
*.yml     eol=lf
.gitignore eol=lf
.prettierrc eol=lf

# Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout.
*.bat     eol=crlf

# Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified.
