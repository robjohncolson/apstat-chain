üéì **A revolutionary decentralized educational platform that transforms AP Statistics learning into an engaging, blockchain-powered collaborative experience.**

## üåü What Makes APStat Chain Special

APStat Chain reimagines educational technology by eliminating centralized infrastructure and putting students in control of their learning data. Through innovative "social consensus" mechanisms, students validate each other's work while building an immutable record of their academic achievements.

### üéØ Core Philosophy

- **Student Sovereignty**: Students own and control their learning data through cryptographic identity
- **Peer Collaboration**: Academic integrity through peer validation rather than centralized answer keys  
- **Zero Infrastructure**: Completely serverless architecture with no backend dependencies
- **Transparent Progress**: Immutable, auditable record of all learning activities
- **Gamified Learning**: Mission Control dashboard with competitive elements and achievement rewards

## üöÄ Key Features

### üîó Blockchain Learning Records
- **Proof of Knowledge Transactions**: Academic achievements cryptographically signed and permanently recorded
- **Immutable Ledger**: Tamper-evident history of all learning activities across the network
- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: 12-word mnemonic phrases for student-controlled account management
- **Chain Validation**: Complete blockchain with genesis block and cryptographic integrity verification

### ü§ù Social Consensus Innovation
- **Peer Mining**: Students propose blocks by solving AP Statistics puzzles
- **Attestation System**: Network validates proposed answers through peer review
- **Dynamic Quorum**: Attestation requirements automatically adjust (30% of peers, min 3, max 7)
- **Academic Integrity**: Consensus mechanism ensures answer accuracy without centralized control

### üåê Pure P2P Networking
- **WebRTC Communication**: Real-time peer-to-peer data sharing using PeerJS
- **DNS-Based Discovery**: Serverless peer discovery through DNS TXT records
- **Mesh Network Formation**: Automatic peer introduction and network topology optimization
- **State Synchronization**: Real-time mempool and blockchain sync across all nodes

### üéÆ Gamified Mission Control Interface
