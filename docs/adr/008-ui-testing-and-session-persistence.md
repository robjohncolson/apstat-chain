# ADR-008: UI Testing and Session Persistence

## Status
Accepted

## Context

After implementing the initial UI features in Phase 5 (`Ledger`, `Leaderboard`, transaction creation), a review revealed several quality issues that need to be addressed before proceeding to Phase 6:

1. **Missing Test Coverage**: The UI components (`Dashboard`, `Ledger`, `Leaderboard`) were developed without corresponding tests, creating technical debt and reducing confidence in the codebase.

2. **Incomplete Session Persistence**: The planned session persistence feature was not fully implemented, harming the user experience by requiring users to re-enter their wallet information on every application restart.

3. **Quality Inconsistency**: While our core packages (`@apstat-chain/core` and `@apstat-chain/p2p`) maintain high test coverage and quality standards, the UI layer lacks the same rigor.

## Decision 1: Implement Test-Driven Session Persistence

We will add session persistence functionality to maintain user wallet state across application restarts:

- **Implementation**: Add a startup-only `useEffect` hook in `App.tsx` that attempts to restore a user's wallet from a mnemonic stored in `localStorage`
- **Validation**: Create a new test file `App.test.tsx` that uses React Testing Library to verify the session restoration functionality with mocked `localStorage`
- **User Experience**: This will eliminate the need for users to re-enter their wallet information on every application start

## Decision 2: Backfill Component Tests

We will create comprehensive test coverage for existing UI components to bring them up to the same quality standard as our core packages:

- **Test Framework**: Use React Testing Library and Vitest (consistent with our existing testing infrastructure)
- **Component Coverage**: Create dedicated test files for:
  - `Dashboard.test.tsx`
  - `Ledger.test.tsx` 
  - `Leaderboard.test.tsx`
- **Test Scope**: Tests will verify:
  - Components render correctly based on mocked data from the `BlockchainProvider`
  - User interactions (like clicking "Complete Lesson") trigger the correct service methods
  - Component state management and props handling

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Increased Confidence**: Comprehensive test coverage will reduce the risk of regressions when making future changes
- **Better User Experience**: Session persistence will complete the core user experience loop by maintaining wallet state
- **Quality Consistency**: UI layer will match the high quality standards established in our core packages
- **Foundation for Growth**: A well-tested codebase will support more complex features in Phase 6

### Negative
- **Development Delay**: This "hardening" phase will slightly delay the implementation of the blockchain state layer (Phase 6)
- **Context Switching**: Team will need to shift focus from new feature development to test implementation

### Neutral
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Addressing test coverage now prevents larger refactoring efforts later
- **Established Patterns**: Component testing patterns established here will guide future UI development

## Implementation Notes

This decision prioritizes codebase stability and user experience over rapid feature development, aligning with our commitment to building a robust and reliable application foundation.
