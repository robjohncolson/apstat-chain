Problem #	Type	Correlated Topics
1	MCQ	Unit 9: 9.5 Carrying Out a Test for the Slope of a Regression Model, Unit 6: 6.5 Interpreting p-Values, 6.6 Concluding a Test for a Population Proportion (concepts of hypothesis testing and p-values apply broadly, even though this is a regression context)
2	MCQ	Unit 9: 9.2 Confidence Intervals for the Slope of a Regression Model
3	MCQ	Unit 7: 7.6 Confidence Intervals for the Difference of Two Means, also arguably best practice to use paired t-test. The question stem indicates a focus on the procedure selection, making Unit 7 skills.
